# hello-world
first repository. first time on github. hoping for the best.

it is me, 13. i'm gonna try and learn some javascript because that seems like a useful thing to know if i already know html and css
it's gonna be hard and annoying probably but it'll make some good reading on my personal statement
i hope.
